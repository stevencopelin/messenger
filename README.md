# Messenger App

Since Messenger has decided to remove the App for Windows and OSX etc, pluse removal of their .com in April 2026. I had a few friends that wanted an App to run on their desktops.

Its just a wrapper for the messenger end point.
I'd say FB will most likely cause this to crash at some point, i'll do my bets to keep it updated.

Happy playing!!
