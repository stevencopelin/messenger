# Messenger App

Since Messenger has decided to remove the App for Windows and OSX etc, pluse removal of their .com in April 2026. I had a few friends that wanted an App to run on their desktops.

Its just a wrapper for the messenger end point.
I'd say FB will most likely cause this to crash at some point, i'll do my bets to keep it updated.

INSTALLATION
Download and run either of the executables for OSX intel/ARM or Windows.
On mac's i have had a problem dues to not being a auth'd by Apple

in Terminal: xattr -cr /Applications/Messenger.app (or the location of the app)

Couple of small issues that i'll resolve soon, seems to hang every now and then and history can take a little while to update.

Happy playing!!
